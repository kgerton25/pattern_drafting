## Welcome to the Sewing Pattern DraftR

I spent my COVID quarantine learning how to sew clothes. Luckily for my data-oriented self, I came across Dorothy Moore's **Pattern Drafting and Dressmaking** book pretty early. This book provides a mathematical and graphical approach to drafting sewing patterns based on your individual measurements. 

I spent the first several months improving my hand drafted patterns--I took over the entire dining room with giant paper and rulers--to the point where I was achieving consistent pattern success that actually resulted in wearable garments! 

I then started to think about how I could make my life easier and not have to start from scratch every time I wanted to start a new project. Resuability, afterall, is a core principle of good design. Thus this shiny app was born! I took Ms. Moore's directions and turned them into a set of directions to generate the major pattern points based on input body measurements and output a final, printable pattern.

Enjoy!
